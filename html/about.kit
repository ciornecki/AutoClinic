                            <p class="story-text">AutoClinic was founded in 2010 by two lifelong friends, John and
                                Michael, who shared a passion for cars and a desire to provide exceptional service to
                                their
                                customers. They started out in a small garage, working long hours to repair and maintain
                                vehicles for friends and family. As their reputation for quality workmanship and
                                personalized service grew, so did their business. Today, AutoClinic is a thriving auto
                                repair service with a team of experienced mechanics and staff who are committed to
                                delivering the same level of service that John and Michael started with a decade ago.
